You will not remove any copyright or other proprietary notice from the Materials. You agree to prevent any unauthorized copying of the Materials. Except as expressly provided herein, no license or right is granted to You directly or by implication, inducement, estoppel or otherwise; specifically Intel does not grant any express or implied right to You under Intel patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets.

7. NO WARRANTY, NO SUPPORT: Disclaimer. Intel disclaims all warranties of any kind and the terms and remedies provided in this Agreement are instead of any other warranty or condition, express, implied or statutory, including those regarding merchantability, fitness for any particular purpose, non-infringement, or any warranty arising out of any course of dealing, usage of trade, proposal, specification or sample. Intel does not assume (and does not authorized any person to assume on its behalf) any other liability.

Intel may make changes to the Materials, or to items referenced therein, at any time without notice, but is not obligated to support, update or provide training for the Materials. Intel may in its sole discretion offer such support, update or training services under separate terms at Intel’s then-current rates. You may request additional information on Intel’s service offerings from an Intel sales representative.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: Neither Intel nor its suppliers shall be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or other loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use the Materials, even if Intel has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Because some jurisdictions prohibit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to You.

9. UNAUTHORIZED USE: The Materials are not designed, intended or authorized for use in any type of a system or application in which the failure of the Materials could create a situation where personal injury or death may occur (e.g., medical systems, life sustaining or lifesaving systems). Should You use the Materials for any such unintended or unauthorized use, You hereby indemnify, defend, and hold Intel and its officers, subsidiaries, and affiliates harmless against all claims, costs, damages, expenses, and reasonable attorney fees arising out of, directly or indirectly, such use and any claim of product liability, personal injury or death associated with such unintended or unauthorized use, even if such claim alleges that Intel was negligent regarding the design or manufacture of the Materials.

10. USER SUBMISSIONS: This Agreement does not obligate You to provide Intel with materials, information, comments, suggestions or other communication regarding the Materials. However, You agree that any material, information, comments, suggestions or other communication You transmit or post to an Intel website (including but not limited to, submissions to the Intel Premier Support and/or other customer support websites or online portals) or provide to Intel under this Agreement related to the features, functions, performance or use of the Materials are deemed non-confidential and non-proprietary ("Communications"). Intel will have no obligations with respect to the Communications. You hereby grant to Intel a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, copyright license to copy, modify, create derivative works, publicly display, disclose, distribute, license, and sublicense through multiple tiers of distribution and licensees, incorporate and otherwise use the Communications and all data, images, sounds, text, and other things embodied therein, including derivative works thereto, for any and all commercial or non-commercial purposes. You are prohibited from posting or transmitting to or from an Intel website or provide to Intel any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, or other material that would violate any law. If You wish to provide Intel with information that You intend to be treated as confidential information, Intel requires that such confidential information be provided pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”), so please contact Your Intel representative to ensure the proper NDA is in place.

Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as preventing Intel from reviewing Your Communications and errors or defects in Intel products discovered while reviewing Your Communications. Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as preventing Intel from implementing independently-developed enhancements to Intel’s own error diagnosis methodology to detect errors or defects in Intel products discovered while reviewing Your Communications or to implement bug fixes or enhancements in Intel products. The foregoing may include the right to include Your Communications in regression test suites.

11. NON-DISCLOSURE: You will maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information (if any) with at least the same degree of care that You use to protect Your own confidential and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care under the circumstances. You will not disclose the Confidential Information to any employees or to any third parties except to Your employees who have a need to know and who agree to abide by nondisclosure terms at least as comprehensive as those set forth herein; provided that You will be liable for breach by any such entity. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “employee” will include your independent contractors, who have signed confidentiality agreements with You. You will not make any copies of the Confidential Information except as necessary for Your employees with a need to know. Any copies which are made will be identified as belonging to Intel and marked “confidential”, “proprietary” or with similar legend. You will not be liable for the disclosure of any Confidential Information which is (a) generally made available publicly or to third parties by Intel without restriction on disclosure; (b) rightfully received from a third party without obligation of confidentiality; (c) rightfully known to You without any limitation on disclosure prior to Your receipt from Intel; (d) independently developed by Your employees; or (e) required to be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, court, judicial or other government order, provided that You will give Intel reasonable notice prior to such disclosure and will comply with any applicable protective order.

12. TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE: This Agreement becomes effective on the date You accept this Agreement and will continue until terminated as provided for in this Agreement. If the Materials include Pre-Release Materials, the licenses to the Pre-Release Materials terminate without notice on the earlier of (a) last day of the pre-release period, which may be specified in the Materials, or (b) upon the commercial release of the Pre-Release Materials. If You received the Materials for Evaluation, the licenses terminate without notice at the end of the Evaluation Period. Intel may terminate this license immediately if You are in breach of any of its terms and conditions and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days of written notice from Intel. Upon termination, You will immediately return to Intel or destroy the Materials and all copies thereof. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the license grant to any Materials or Redistributables distributed by You in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the effective date of such termination, will survive any such termination of this Agreement. Sections 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, and 13 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.
