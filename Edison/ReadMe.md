You can watch the messages that pop up on your laptop by typing
```
dmesg
```

Configure or copy: type the below command and press Enter button twice
Username: root, password: 12345678
```
sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```
Get edison IP address:
```
ifconfig
```
192.168.42.1

type in your laptop
```
 sudo lsusb
```
you should see a line with
```
ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 USB-Serial (UART) IC
```
type in your laptop
```
ls /dev/ttyUSB*
```
you should see
```
/dev/ttyUSB0
```
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch Edison/edison.image Edison/edison.zip Edison/iot-devkit-prof-dev-image-edison-20160606.zip' -f HEAD

# 2. Enable Access Point (AP) mode for the board
https://software.intel.com/en-us/getting-started-with-ap-mode-for-intel-edison-board
The following instructions work best on an Intel速 Edison board assembled with the Arduino expansion board. 
To enter AP Mode with the Intel速 Edison mini breakout board, 
you must establish a serial communication session with your board and use the command line:
```
configure_edison --enableOneTimeSetup.
```
Entering AP mode and connecting to a Wi-Fi network

    * On your board, hold down the button labeled PWR for more than 2 seconds but no longer than 7 seconds. Around 4 seconds is sufficient.

    * The LED at JS2 near the center of the board should now be blinking. It will remain blinking as long as your board is in AP mode.
    * In a few moments, a Wi-Fi network hotspot appears. Typically, its name is in the form of: Edison-xx-xx, where xx-xx is the last two places of your board's Wi-Fi mac address. This mac address is on a label within the plastic chip holder that contained the Intel速 Edison chipset within the packaging. However, if you have given your board a name, the Wi-Fi hotspot has the same name.
    * When you find your board's Wi-Fi hotspot, attempt to connect.  The passcode necessary to connect is the chipset serial number, which is also on the label in the plastic chip holder beneath the mac address.  Additionally, a small white label on the Intel速 Edison chipset itself also states the serial number. The passcode is case-sensitive.
    * Once you have connected to the hotspot, open a browser (preferably Firefox or Chrome) and enter Edison.local in the URL bar. The following screen displays: 

You want manuelly to switch back from AP mode in Client mode of Wifi? simply run 
configure_edison --setup again
```
systemctl stop hostapd
systemctl disable hostapd
systemctl enable wpa_supplicant
systemctl start wpa_supplicant
wpa_cli reconfigure
wpa_cli select_network wlan0
udhcpc -i wlan0
```

Install nmap to check port open or not
```
sudo apt-get install nmap
nmap -p 22 192.168.42.1
```
Then you need to connect your laptop to Edison AP
# 3. Enable Pulse Server
type the below command (copy then click middle mouse button to paste)
```
cd Drone/trackerbots_telemetry/pulse_server/
./target/release/pulse_server

```
